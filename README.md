# Deep Recusion

Deep recursion in general leads to stack overflow, so it would be a good
name to start a project like Stack Overflow.

## at the moment...

Here is nothing. Absolutely nothing except db config as a stub and customized
.gitignore. Not even custom useful gems in Gemfile.

It's just a start.
